# Experiment 3

Expt 3. Implement 8 puzzle using the HIll climbing algorithm
Use two different initial configurations such that

1. A initial configuration that leads to a local maxima or plateau where the algorithm terminates.
2. A initial configuration that leads to the global maximum being reached, that is the objective function reaches a maximum value of 8, which means all the tiles are in position.
